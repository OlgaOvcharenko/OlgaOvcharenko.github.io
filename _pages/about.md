Olga Ovcharenko is a first-year Data Science master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), Switzerland. Olga’s interest in data science started with her undergraduate Data Management course at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home/), Austria. She mainly focused on distributed storage, analysis, and stream processing. Olga was part of the [DAMSLab](https://damslab.github.io) headed and supervised by [Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/). Olga had been working on the [ExDRa](https://www.exdra.de) project (exploratory data science over raw data) and contributing to the federated backend of [Apache SystemDS](https://systemds.apache.org/), an open-source ML system for the end-to-end data science lifecycle. She implemented federated components such as linear algebra operations and low-level instructions. Olga is an official Apache SystemDS committer and has coauthored joint SIGMOD and CIKM papers with Siemens, TU Berlin, DFKI, and TU Graz. For her bachelor’s thesis, Olga built a distributed data generator to scale real datasets preserving statistics and error distribution of the original data.

Currently, Olga is collaborating with [Prof. Theodoros (Theo) Rekatsinas](https://thodrek.github.io).
<!-- As a continuation of her research work, Olga is currently collaborating with [Prof. Theodoros (Theo) Rekatsinas](https://thodrek.github.io) in the Systems Lab at ETH Zurich.  -->
